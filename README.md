# RATVM (RAGE AGAINST THE VENDING MACHINES) Group Project


Short project description goes here:
Did the vending machine eat your money again? Did that bag of potato chips fall midway and get stuck?

Don't worry, we are a student-run RCB project with one driving mission: to provide the snacks that YOU want, cheaply and conveniently. Let us know what you're craving! We will do our best to provide what the student body desires, because we know that a hungry coder is a distracted coder, and we want to contribute to an atmosphere of academic success!
The vending machines at the Atrium sometimes failed to deliver a snack that was paid for. This, combined with various complaints about the snacks being overpriced, gave birth to our project, “RAGE AGAINST THE VENDING MACHINE!” We know that a hungry coder is a distracted coder, so to remedy this problem, we started bringing affordable snacks to the bootcamp.
